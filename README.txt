HELLO READER! KINDLY READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE PLAYING THE GAME!	

Life Below Water - A simple shooter game developed by Sparsh. Double click on the file 'life_below_water.py' python 
file to run the game

This game consists of a spaceship in the bottom center of the screen with some trash and fishes swimming under the 
water. Your job is to shoot out all the trash before it reaches close to your spaceship!

You may see my gameplay video named 'Gameplay.mp4' in the folder in which you found this 'README' file.

Use ← and → to move the spaceship right or left and press 'Space' to shoot.
Shooting the trash will give you +1 point and fish will give -1. The top left corner will show you the score.

The game will show 'GAME OVER' when the trash reaches close to the spaceship. To play again, close the window and 
relaunch the game.

Note! : Please make sure that everything you find in the "Life Below Water" game folder is not misplaced, otherwise
some elements of the game may go missing or game may show error. 

I hope you will the game!
Happy Gaming!
